What is Terradoo Cloud ?
========================

  The main objective of Terradoo Cloud is to transform Odoo into a Multi Cloud Native Business suite.

  With an approach based on microservices it intents to build a solution for Odoo Community on a Multi Cloud Native Architecture.

  OpenERP is a well designed software but it inherits a monolithic approach.

  Luckily, it's designed with MVC web server pattern and it has a powerful ORM with a tight database integration within a powerful RDMS.

  So, ideally, it could be possible to split Odoo into microservices. But, it isn't the main goal of this project.

  However, an OpenERP/Odoo based project may needs other supporting servicesand applications. Terradoo cloud aims to provide a seamless solution to bundle such a project as a Multi Cloud Native application. 

  For example, an Odoo CE based project may needs additional services for email, communication, backup, monitoring, logging, tracing, security,
  domain names, networking etc.

  Odoo.sh is one of the solutions that offers services around Odoo that meet cloud and modern principles such as DevOps. So, Why Terradoo Cloud ?
